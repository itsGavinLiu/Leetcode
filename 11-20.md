## Leetcode 11
Question: Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Analysis:
- Binary pointer is a good way to move left and right column and calcualte maxmimum area. The key part is to move the shorter height among 2 pointers to the next position otherwise the area would be smaller.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        res = 0
        while left < right:
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            res = max(res, area)
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return res
    
```
