# Leetcode 31

Question: Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

Analysis:
- What is the next permutation? First, this number is greatrer than current number. Second, the difference is as close as possible
- From right to left, We need to find the first pair of two successive numbers `a[i]` and `a[j]`, which satisfy `a[i] < a[j]`. In this case, subarrray starting from `a[j]` is descending, which reaches its maximum.
- From right to left again, find the first number which is just larger than `a[i]`, and call it `a[k]`. Swap `a[i]` and `a[k]`. 
- To get the next smallest lexicographic permutation, we can simply reverse the numbers following `a[i]` because the subarray is in descending order.

```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        if len(nums) <= 1 : return

        i, j, k = len(nums)-2, len(nums)-1, len(nums)-1

        # find: A[i] < A[j]
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[j]:
            i = i - 1
            j = j - 1

        if i >= 0:  
            # find: A[i] < A[k]
            while nums[i] >= nums[k]:
                k = k -1
            # swap A[i], A[k]
            nums[i], nums[k] = nums[k], nums[i]

        # reverse A[j:end]
        end = len(nums)-1
        while j < end :
            nums[j], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[j]
            j = j + 1
            end = end - 1
