# Leetcode 31

Question: Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

Analysis:
- What is the next permutation? First, this number is greatrer than current number. Second, the difference is as close as possible
- From right to left, We need to find the first pair of two successive numbers `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`, which satisfy `a[i] > a[i-1]`. In this case, subarrray starting from `a[i]` is descending, which reaches its maximum.
- From right to left again, find the first number which is just larger than `a[i-1]`, and call it `a[j]`. Swap `a[i-1]` and `a[j]`.
