Question: Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, 
convert it to the simplified canonical path.

Analysis:
- For directories, we can go deeper or come back. The final result depends on the memorization of all valid elements and therefore, we can use `stack` to keep track of it. The algorithm is first, if the stack is not empty and we meet `..`, we pop one element from stack to go back. Second, if the element exists and is not `.`, we put it into the end of the stack. Fianlly, we join the result.

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        
        for p in path.split('/'):
            if p == '..':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            elif p and p != '.':
                stack.append(p)
        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```

Question: Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

Analysis:
- If a problem consistes many sub-problems and every state is transferred from the previous state, then we can use dynamic programming. First thing first, we have to understand what is `dp[i][j]`. In this case, it means the edit distance from `word1[i]` to `word2[j]`. If `i` equals 0, it means the edit distance from an empty string. After that, we need to consider state function. We have to consider three operations. 
- `replace`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.  
- `delete`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1`.
- `insert`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1`.
- Finally, we can use `min` to select the minimal state.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

## Leetcode 73

Question: Given an `m x n` integer matrix matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to 0's.

Analysis:
- We can use two marker arrays to store the position of `0`. 

```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        row, col = [False] * m, [False] * n
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    row[i] = col[j] = True
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if row[i] or col[j]:
                    matrix[i][j] = 0                    
```

## Leetcode 74

Question: Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an `m x n` integer matrix.

Analysis:
- Since it is monotonically increasing, we can seem it as a one dimentional array. After that, we can use bianry search.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        left, right = 0, m * n - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            x, y = mid // n , mid % n
            if matrix[x][y] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            elif matrix[x][y] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return True
        return False
```
